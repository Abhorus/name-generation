# name-generation
A tool to generate character names for your RPGs, Novel or any sort of character creation.

## Current Status

For the moment, This repository is just an initial skeleton, mostly for name population. It will take some time to build a robust generation scheme with a complete set of options.
Please help us out by contributing some names to add to the pool!

In the near future, we hope to generate fantasy origin names, like elves, dwarves and tritons.

## Hurdles

Names can be tricky, with so many variants of structure, so we hope to try our best to correctly represent as many valid configurations as possible.

Please be patient with us as we try to best formulate how to enable all sorts of variations. Additionally, Please try not be offended should your name suggestions not be accepted. At first we will try to generate "traditional" names, afterwards, we hope to add the option to mix name-banks and such.

Feel free to add additional name banks, but please comply with our file naming and style conventions.
