Generation of character names

For the moment, This repository is just an initial skeleton for name population.
In the future, we wish to provide lots of facilities for generating names for RPGs, Novels or any sort of character creation.

Names can be tricky, with so many variants of structure, so we hope to try our best to correctly represent as many valid configurations as possible.

In the future, we hope to generate fantasy origin names, like elves, dwarves and tritons.

Please be patient with us as we try to best formulate how to enable all sorts of variations. Additionally, Please try not be offended should your name suggestions not be accepted. At first we will try to generate "traditional" names, afterwards, we hope to add the option to mix name-banks and such.

Feel free to add additional name banks, but please comply with our conventions.
